        <h1>The Candle</h1>
        <div>
            You're now in the dark, save for a box of candles you could salvage.
            However, those candles will burn forever; which is not likely to
            happen in the real world.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
            <strong>Your goal:</strong> find a way to make the candle burn to the
            end with useState and useEffect hooks in React
        </div>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a state that will hold the value of the candle's height in
                your component. Set its default value to 80.
            </li>
            <li>
                The height of the candle is controlled by the candle class in the
                CSS file. Target the height value and set it to reflect your newly
                created state
            </li>
            <li>
                On the "Make candle smaller" button, attach an onClick handler that
                will diminish the height of the candle by 1 everytime it's clicked
            </li>
            <li>
                Now, being <del>lazy</del> good developers, we would like automate
                that process so we don't have to click on a button for the candle to
                become smaller. Implement a useEffect hook to take care of this. The
                candle should diminish by 1% every 2 seconds
            </li>
            <li>
                When the height of the candle reaches 10%, make sure you take it out
                so you don't burn this sandbox down! For this, you should
                conditionaly render (or not) the whole candle based on its height
            </li>
            <li>
                We don't want to be stuck in the dark, do we? Change the "Make
                candle smaller" button to "Replace with new candle", and implement a
                function that will refresh the candle to its original state
            </li>
        </ul>
